# 4-bit-ADDER


**OBJECTIVE**

**Objective:**

* Write Verilog code for a 4-bit adder.
* Verify functionality using a test bench.
* Perform synthesis and analyze: critical path, max frequency, total cells, power, and area.


**DESCRIPTION**

A full adder is a combinational circuit that performs the arithmetic sum of three input bits
Ai, addend Bi and carry in C in from the previous adder. Its results contain the sum Si and the
carry out, C out to the next stage. So to design a 4-bit adder circuit we start by designing the 1 â€“
bit full adder then connecting the four 1-bit full adders to get the 4-bit adder as shown in the
diagram below. For the 1-bit full adder, the design begins by drawing the Truth Table for the
three input and the corresponding output SUM and CARRY.
